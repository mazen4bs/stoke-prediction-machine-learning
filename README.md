# Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project was completed as part of the **CSE381: Introduction to Machine Learning** course at Ain Shams University (Spring 2025), under the supervision of **Dr. Mahmoud Khalil** and **TA Eng. Engy Ahmed Hassan**.

##  Course Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of stroke in patients using clinical and lifestyle data. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally, and early risk prediction can significantly reduce its impact. We used a real-world dataset and implemented both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to uncover meaningful patterns and classify at-risk individuals.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3.12**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data manipulation and numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualizations and statistical plots  
- **Scikit-learn** – used for classification (SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree), dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA, t-SNE), clustering, and evaluation metrics  
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** – to handle class imbalance in stroke predictions  
- **Optuna** – for automated and efficient hyperparameter optimization  
- **GridSearchCV** – for manual hyperparameter tuning  
- **StandardScaler & LabelEncoder** – for preprocessing and normalization  
- **KMeans & Agglomerative Clustering** – for grouping similar patient profiles without using labels
